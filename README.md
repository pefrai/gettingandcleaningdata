* CodeBook.md  
This file describes the original data set and the transformations applied to fulfill the assignment, ending in the generation of the file tidy_dataset.txt.

* run_analysis.R  
Script used to transform the original UCI data set (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into the final tidy data set, as per the assignment instructions.  
Other than the comments in the file itself, the steps are explained in CodeBook.md.

* tidy_dataset.txt  
File containing the final tidy dataset, generated by run_analysis.R through

        write.table(tidy_dataset, file = "tidy_dataset.txt", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)

    To read back the file and check the results, one can invoke 

        test_dataset <- read.table("tidy_dataset.txt", header = TRUE)
        View(test_dataset)
